* Me
I am interested in type theory and high-performance systems.
During the day, I work on a low-latency trading system at an investment bank.

I am curious about ways to _ergonomically reason about the correctness_ of a _fast_ program.

* Notes
Some experiments with C++ metaprogramming are underway!

* Archives
Earlier when I worked in cybersecurity research, I wrote some technical articles.
