\title{Sense}

\p{
As the name suggests, \em{sense} is what we perceive.
Well, it is what we write on paper (or type on a computer).
}

\p{
Consider the example: #{1+2=3}.
On the left side, we write #{1+2}, and on the right, #{3}.
}

\p{
They are just writings/symbols though. They can mean something, or nothing at all.
It is \em{meaningful} for us to assign meaning to each symbol.
}
