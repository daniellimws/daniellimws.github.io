abstract = {Multithreaded programming is difficult and error prone. It is easy to make a mistake in synchronization that produces a data race, yet it can be extremely hard to locate this mistake during debugging. This article describes a new tool, called Eraser, for dynamically detecting data races in lock-based multithreaded programs. Eraser uses binary rewriting techniques to monitor every shared-monory reference and verify that consistent locking behavior is observed. We present several case studies, including undergraduate coursework and a multithreaded Web search engine, that demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.},
